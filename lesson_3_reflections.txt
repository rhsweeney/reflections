When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
Probably when you wanna collab with other people or show off your stuff

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Same reason as why Git doesn't auto-save. Sometimes you're just not ready for 
your changes to be pushed publicly. I know Caroline mentioned earlier that 
you may want the feature you are working on to be fully completed before pushing 
it into the public domain (aka GitHub).
